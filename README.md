Checkers Game with Least Mean Squares Learning

Overview
This project implements a machine learning algorithm using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) learning rule to play the game of checkers. The program generates its training experience by playing games with itself. The goal is to develop a checkers-playing agent that improves its performance over time through self-play and reinforcement learning techniques.

Requirements
To run this program, you need:

Python 3.x
Required libraries (NumPy, etc.)
Checkers game environment (if not implemented within the project)
Installation
Clone or download the project repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip or any package manager.
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Optionally, set up the checkers game environment if not included in the project.
Usage
Run the main program file.
The program initiates self-play sessions where the agent learns by playing against itself.
As the training progresses, the agent's performance should improve.
You can tweak hyperparameters and settings to optimize learning.
Implementation Details
Checkers Environment: The checkers game environment provides the rules and logic for the game. It should include functions for generating legal moves, checking for game termination, and updating the game state.

LMS Learning Rule: The LMS learning rule is a simple yet effective algorithm for updating the weights of a neural network in a supervised or reinforcement learning setting. In this case, it is used to update the agent's policy or value function based on the outcomes of self-play games.

Self-Play: The agent generates training experience by playing games against itself. This allows it to explore different strategies and learn from its own mistakes.

Training Loop: The main program contains a training loop where the agent plays self-play games and updates its parameters using the LMS learning rule. The loop continues until convergence or a predefined number of iterations.

Evaluation: Optionally, the trained agent can be evaluated against human players or other pre-existing checkers algorithms to assess its performance.

Additional Notes
Performance Metrics: You may track various performance metrics during training, such as win rate against random opponents, convergence speed, and exploration rate.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, exploration strategies, and neural network architectures to find the optimal configuration for your agent.

Visualization: You can visualize the training progress and the learned policy or value function using plots or other visualization tools.

Extensions: Consider extending the project by implementing more advanced learning algorithms, integrating neural networks for policy/value function approximation, or developing a graphical user interface for the game.
